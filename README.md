# School_District_Analysis

# Overview
Maria has been notified by the school board that reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders have been altered, which essentially means that our analysis might not be relibale when it comes to its findings. The school board has reasons to believe that some sort of academic dishonesty has, in fact, taken place, however the extent of it remains unknown. We have been authorized to repeat the analysis, ignoring the resluts of Tomas High School for the students of the ninth grade. As per the board's directive, we were also required to compare the new results of our analysis to the orginal ones, in order to see how the exclusion of the above mentioned students' data affected our overall district perfomance.

 As we can see Thomas High School is most definitely not one of the top schools of its district based on the overall student perfomance, in fact, it is one of the lowest performing. THS' overall passing rate is significantly lower than district's.

It's safe to conclude that schools with the highest amount of money spent per student do not guarantee great scores, quite the opposie is true - those schols with the lowest spending per person tend to have students who perform much better.
